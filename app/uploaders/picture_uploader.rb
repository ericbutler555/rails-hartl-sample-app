  # resize image proportionally on upload to be max 400px on either side:
  process resize_to_limit: [400, 400]

  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # NOTE: uncomment below to use cloud storage in production.
  # if Rails.env.production?
  #   storage :fog # store file to cloud provider (Heroku)
  # else
    storage :file # store file to local folder
  # end

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"
  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url(*args)
  #   # For Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline compatibility:
  #   # ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))
  #
  #   "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')
  # end

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process scale: [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process resize_to_fit: [100, 100]
    # NOTE: both "resize_to_limit" and "resize_to_fit" scale proportionally to fit within the stated dimensions, but resize_to_fit will scale an image UP if necessary, while resize_to_limit will leave a smaller image alone.
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_whitelist
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
  # end
